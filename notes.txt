Generic Dungeon Rooms
. Give your dungeon a theme before anything else. "Orc Fortress", "Ice Dragon's Glacier Cave", "Wizard's Laboratory."
. Only roll when it's not obvious what comes next, if you have a cool idea you should use it immediately.
. Besides the entrance, add d4-1 exits to each room. You don't need to complete the whole map at once, 5 rooms is fine.
. 1-in-3 times add OSHA-violating hazards to the room. This is a dungeon, not a theme park.

* Literalism: Our holy texts clearly state divine intent, and human interpretation is of limited value.

* Sky Burials: The dead should not be imprisoned underground — it is far better to allow them to be consumed by scavenging birds, where in a final act of generosity they can feed the world that fed them.

* Syncretism: The wisest amongst us should be allowed to study other faiths and learn more about the people around us.
* War Worship: the gods are in eternal wars and conflicts with each other. If we are to emulate them and worship them as they deserve, we have to be ready to fight.

* Mastery over Undeath: We have been blessed with the powers of necromancy. These powers should be considered sacred, and part of our bound with the divine.
