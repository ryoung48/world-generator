Generic Dungeon Rooms
. Give your dungeon a theme before anything else. "Orc Fortress", "Ice Dragon's Glacier Cave", "Wizard's Laboratory."
. Only roll when it's not obvious what comes next, if you have a cool idea you should use it immediately.
. Besides the entrance, add d4-1 exits to each room. You don't need to complete the whole map at once, 5 rooms is fine.
. 1-in-3 times add OSHA-violating hazards to the room. This is a dungeon, not a theme park.

* Asceticism: Materialistic pursuits blind us to the divine truth. Only by devoting ourselves to live simple lives without luxury can we achieve spiritual enlightenment.
* Astrology: The night sky is our window into the realm of the divine. The great secrets and mysteries of the world are written there, open for all to learn if they know where to look.
* Carnal Exaltation: The pleasures of the flesh are sublime in a way that transcends other earthly experiences, bringing us closer to the divine. We should glorify our sexual desires and seek out opportunities for us to fulfill them.
* Communal Identity: Our faith and our culture are intrinsically linked together. This practice strengthens the bonds of our community, though it tends to exclude foreigners.
* Communion: Our rituals are not merely symbolic — they invoke the very presence of the divine itself. Those who cannot or do not join us in their practice cannot be true believers.
* Divine Marriage: The blood of the divine runs through the veins of our kings and queens. Keeping our bloodlines pure is the best way to ensure our family's reign continues for centuries to come.
* Ecclesiarchy: Our holy sites are more than just sacred places — they are the very seats of power from which our religious leaders rule.
* Esotericism: The great mysteries of the divine may be beyond mortal comprehension, but that is not an excuse for ignorance. Their very existence compels us to seek knowledge and understanding of the world around us.
* Gnosticism: Through knowledge, the divine spark that rests inside all humans may be liberated and returned to its heavenly source in the spirit-realm.
* Legalism: Our laws are the result of generations of wisdom and devoutness, and adhering to them is by its very nature pious. A sinner, no matter who, will never be above the law.
* Literalism: Our holy texts clearly state divine intent, and human interpretation is of limited value.
* Mendicant Preachers: Our missionaries travel far and wide with nothing but the clothes they wear on their back. They live off the generosity of those they visit, and share the knowledge of the true faith in return.
* Monasticism: The pleasures of fine food and drink only serve to distract us from service to the divine. Isolating ourselves in remote monasteries is the best way to avoid these temptations.
* Polyamory: Our love for each other should be as unconditional. We must cast away the outdated notions of one person owning the affections of another.
* Religious Law: The border between theological and legal arguments is thin, and spiritual qualities can and should be considered in secular settlements.

* Ancestor Worship: Our ancestors watch over us from beyond the grave, guiding us and showing us the way forward. For this we must respect and honor them.

* Armed Pilgrimages: Our pilgrims travel across the world to visit our sacred holy sites — we will gladly take up the sword to keep them safe from any who would harm them.
* Patron Gods: Mortals cannot live up to the full glory of the divine, but by selecting a single aspect of divinity to emulate, worship and devote oneself to, we can come closer to them than otherwise would be possible.
* Pacifism: Violence is an abhorrent act that only leads to suffering, pain and regret. By working to avoid it whenever possible we can build stronger, more secure societies for the faithful to live in.
* Hedonistic: The divine filled this world with a bounty of pleasures for us to indulge in and enjoy — to not partake of such things is to snub the very work of creation itself.
* Human Sacrifice: The best way to prove our devotion is through the act of sacrifice. The most valuable sacrifice we can offer is the sacrifice of human life.
* Inner Journey: Only by understanding one's self can we understand the world. The journey of self-discovery is important as it is long and difficult.

* Sacred Childbirth: The bathhouses where mothers give birth must be cleansed and prepared with the proper rituals, in order to encourage the divine to grant us their blessing during childbirth.

* Sky Burials: The dead should not be imprisoned underground — it is far better to allow them to be consumed by scavenging birds, where in a final act of generosity they can feed the world that fed them.
* Warmonger: Faith and war go hand in hand. One who refuses to fight in the name of the divine cannot be called a true believer.
* Sun Worship: 	The light-bringer, the live-giver, the ever-burning flame — It reigns high in the sky as the true sovereign of the world.
* Oracles: Only through the proper use of divination can we discern the will of the gods and lead our armies to victory.
* Syncretism: The wisest amongst us should be allowed to study other faiths and learn more about the people around us.
* War Worship: the gods are in eternal wars and conflicts with each other. If we are to emulate them and worship them as they deserve, we have to be ready to fight.
* Veneration of knowledge: Knowledge is the source of all power. We should always seek more, even if onyl for its own sake.
* Mastery over Undeath: We have been blessed with the powers of necromancy. These powers should be considered sacred, and part of our bound with the divine.

* Daedric Bargains
* moon worship: the moons are divine forces that exert a tremendous, yet incomprehensibly subtle influence on the world. from the rising of tides, to the grow of plants, to the cycle of waking and dreaming
