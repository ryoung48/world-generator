Generic Dungeon Rooms
. Give your dungeon a theme before anything else. "Orc Fortress", "Ice Dragon's Glacier Cave", "Wizard's Laboratory."
. Only roll when it's not obvious what comes next, if you have a cool idea you should use it immediately.
. Besides the entrance, add d4-1 exits to each room. You don't need to complete the whole map at once, 5 rooms is fine.
. 1-in-3 times add OSHA-violating hazards to the room. This is a dungeon, not a theme park.
