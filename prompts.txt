* Name: Selush
* Climate: Steppe 
* Terrain: Plains (inland, lake facing)
* Population (14k): Talush (74%), Unal (8%), Ixiis (6%), Oneshog (3%), Enfal (3%), Other (6%)

Given the following village description:

The village of Shafud is a small settlement situated in an arid region with a desert terrain. The village is located on the shore of a small lake which provides a source of fresh water for the villagers. The climate is hot and dry, with very little rainfall throughout the year.

The population of Shafud consists of 213 individuals, with the majority being Oguan, making up 86% of the population. The Asadun people make up 7%, while the Othen and Otunur each make up 3% of the population. The Eleon people make up the remaining 2%, and the remaining 1% is comprised of various other ethnic groups.

The village has a unique history as it is known for being an ideal location for the breeding of a large avian species. This animal is highly prized and is a significant source of income for the village. The villagers have learned to breed and raise these animals successfully, and their feathers and eggs are in high demand throughout the region.

The leadership of the village is split between two individuals: the richest native of the village, who is currently struggling to maintain his wealth, and a pragmatic warlord who is respected by the villagers. The warlord is responsible for the village's defense and security, while the richest native is responsible for managing the village's economic affairs.

However, the village is facing a crisis as a socially marginal family is suspected of committing a series of crimes that have disrupted the village's peace. The villagers are divided in their opinions, with some calling for the family's punishment while others argue for their innocence. This conflict has caused tension among the villagers and has disrupted the village's social harmony.

In terms of subsistence, the villagers rely on light agriculture and herding to sustain their livelihoods. They cultivate crops that are suited to the arid climate, such as date palms and wheat. Livestock such as goats and sheep are herded by the villagers and provide meat and dairy products. Fishing in the lake is also a common activity, providing a source of protein for the villagers.

Overall, Shafud is a small but unique village in a harsh and unforgiving environment. The village's reliance on the large avian species for economic prosperity, coupled with the leadership struggles and social unrest, makes it an intriguing place to visit or explore.

Below are some ideas for how to use the Enemy, Friend, Thing, Place, and Complication tables to generate a story hook.

  'A Place has been overwhelmed by some danger related to a Complication, and a Friend is now trapped there.',
  'A Place has changed, becoming much more dangerous due to the influence of an Enemy. This is causing problems for a Friend.',
  'A Place has been overrun by an Enemy or their agents in an attempt to find a Thing that is supposedly located there.',
  'A Place is currently the focal point of a Complication that is threatening a Friend.',
  'A Place is being reclaimed by a Friend from its current difficulties, but an Enemy has reasons to oppose that change and is using a Complication to interfere.',
  'A Place is the destination to which a Friend must take a Thing. An Enemy means to waylay them, however.',
  "A Place is the source of an Enemy's power, and they guard it jealously. Despite this, a Friend knows of a Thing located there.",
  'A Place offers refuge from a Complication that is currently making trouble in the area, but an Enemy is preventing others from making use of it unless bribed otherwise.',
  'A Place is falling apart, but the chaos has exposed a chance to get a Thing that is being pursued by an Enemy and others.',
  'A Place is under siege by an Enemy, who is determined to take it before a rival can claim it. A Friend would face disaster if either claimed it.',
  "A Place is currently entrapping an Enemy, who is powerless to escape. They've taken a Thing from a Friend, however, and will release it only when the Friend releases them.",
  'A Place is the inherited property or responsibility of a Friend, but they lack a Thing which is critical to their successful obtaining or maintenance of the place.',
  'A Place conceals its true nature as a very different Place, and a Friend has been unfortunately taken in by it.',
  "A Place has a Thing as an integral part of it, and when an Enemy took it, a resultant Complication started that won't end until it's returned.",
  'A Place is used by an Enemy to create a Thing, the processes and events going on there utilized to produce the desired result.',
  'A Place is distant and the journey there is dangerous, but a Friend offers a Thing if the PCs can get them there safely.',
  "A Place is the seat of an Enemy's power, where they are both most fearsome and least wary. A Friend has a plan to take advantage of that.",
  "A Place is the target of a Complication, and the consequences might ruin it. A Thing is located there, and if it's not grabbed first the Complication will probably wreck or take it.",
  'A Place has been newly-established and is still fragile. A Complication threatens to destroy it.',
  'A Place is a refuge for a Friend, but an Enemy means to bait them out of it or force them to leave with a Complication.',
  'A Place holds a Thing that is vital to the resolution of a Complication, but an Enemy has set up a series of traps and obstacles to prevent the PCs from reaching it.',
  'A Place holds a Thing that is causing a Complication, and the PCs must work with a Friend to prevent the Enemy from obtaining it.'

Below is a description to flavor a fantasy RPG ruin:

Hivemind: A multi-bodied intellect exists in the ruin, whether an ancient AI, hiveminded swarm, telepathic gestalt species, unified golem force, or some other manner of creature. Some such hiveminds are inclined to “recruit” intruders, willing or otherwise. Conflict with these creatures is apt to be very dangerous, as they're capable of coordination at a level impossible to others, yet their single mind makes them more vulnerable to a single point of failure.

And here is a list of places that might be related to such a ruin:
* Living quarters with no private elements
* Swarming chamber full of perfectly-synchronized motion
* Fetid organic queen-lair of the ruling intellect

Use the list of places as inspiration to create 10 more places that might be related to such a ruin. Each places should relate to the hivemind flavor.

* Local temple’s high priest
* Magistrate or judge
* Merchant-prince of wide affairs
* Wealthy scholar-noble
* Feared semi-legit criminal boss

Use the list of places as inspiration to create 10 more upper class npcs.
