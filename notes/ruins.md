Below are some example "moods" to help set the scene of a ruin in a fantasy RPG:

* bloody, the site of awful violence
* brilliant with lights or high windows
* cozy, with signs of recent occupation
* crackling with energy, motion, or sound
* crumbling, its contents falling apart
* dark, lamps and windows darkened
* defaced and spoilt by occupants
* graveyard, full of old yellowed death
* kept in unusually good condition
* lonely, desolate and unvisited
* patched, half-fixed by its occupants
* reeking with decay and corruption

come up with 24 locations that would fit a "oceanic" setting; keep the writing style the same as the examples above
* do not give locations names, instead give them a description (e.g. "cozy tavern, with a large fireplace and a bar")
* locations descriptions should be no more than 75 characters and all lowercase; do not end with a period

come up with a good chat gpt prompt that we can use to create more of these, but for a "mountainous" location instead of "ruins"

Sure! Here's a prompt tailored for generating moods for a mountainous location in a fantasy RPG:

Describe the atmosphere and feeling of a mountainous location in a fantasy RPG setting. The description should set a distinct mood or theme for the place. Examples include: 

* windswept, where the gusts tell tales of ancient times
* treacherous, with hidden pitfalls and dangerous climbs
* echoing, where every sound reverberates mysteriously 
* lush, where mountain meadows bloom with vibrant colors
* frozen, a desolate expanse of ice and snow
* mystical, where legends say dragons once roamed
* serene, with tranquil lakes reflecting the peaks
* inhospitable, where few creatures dare to dwell.

keep the writing style the same as the examples above; come up with 24 examples no more than 75 characters long per example
