* boss: these are the most powerful representatives of the hostile type

using the following facts:

flesh out the the room using the elements above; make sure they all make sense tied together; output as all lowercase in the following format:

  "combat encounter": string, // 150 characters - description of the combat encounter; combat encounters must be challenging for a group of 5 adventurers; do not use the words 'boss', 'elite', or 'common'
}
```

{
  "setting": "the master bedroom lies in ruins, its once-grand bed canopy torn and mattress rotted. the scent of old perfume mingles with dust in the air. pale moonlight filters through cracked, grimy windows, casting eerie shadows.",

  "combat encounter": "a band of feral merfolk have taken up residence in the flooded basement below. hearing the trap activate, they surge up through the rotted floorboards, dragging the adventurers down into a frenzied underwater melee."

        name: string; // two words describing the encounter
        description: string // 150 characters; combat encounters must be challenging for a group of 5 adventurers; combat encounters must be able to fit into any room
    }[]
