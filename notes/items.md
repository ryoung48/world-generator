create a list of 50 items that might be found at a market in a fantasy RPG;

keep in mind the following:
* the market is located in a small town (coastal)
* the surrounding terrain is desert
* the prices should be in copper pieces (cp), given that 1 lb of wheat is worth 1 cp
* make sure each category and rarity is represented at least once
* do not mention any fantasy races (orcs, goblins, ogres, centaurs, dwarves, elves, etc.)
* The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
```json

    "items": {
        "name": string,
        "description": string,
        "weight" string,
        "rarity": "common" | "uncommon" | "rare" | "very rare" | "legendary",

* arbalest: Arbalests are mighty heavy crossbows favored by the stalwart. These require hand-cranking before loading, which makes their rate of fire slow, but their powerful bolts can pierce through even the sturdiest of armors.
* crossbows: Favored by nobles and common foot soldiers alike, crossbows strike a balance between power and speed. They can be cocked by hand, making them swifter than arbalests, but with slightly less power.
* hunting bows: Wielded by forest-dwellers and hunters, hunting bows are swift and silent. Although lacking the force of war bows, their quickness makes them deadly in skilled hands.
* war bows: The war bow, a weapon of choice among warriors and archers, boasts immense draw weight. Its formidable power compensates for the longer draw time as compared to hunting bows.
* blunderbusses: These loud, matchlock firearms unleash a hailstorm of projectiles, making them effective against groups. They have a fearsome reputation but struggle against heavy armor. Like other firearms, they have the ability to harm magical beings and barriers.
* pistols: These small, nimble firearms are favored for their quick reload times, though they lack the punch of larger firearms. They have the unique ability to pierce through magical protections.
* arquebuses: The arquebuses, with their matchlock mechanism, are feared for their high power and precision. Their projectiles can penetrate mystical shields and strike down ethereal foes.
* wands: Crafted from wood or bone, wands are the companions of spell-casters. Not as potent as rods or scepters, they make up for it with a faster rate of magical energy projection.
* scepters: Majestic scepters are often the mark of distinguished mages. They have versatile damage types and exude an aura of command and control.
* rods: Mighty rods, adorned with heads at both ends, are the largest of the magical implements. They channel vast amounts of arcane energy, though at a slower pace than wands and scepters.
* daggers: Daggers are swift and nimble, favored by rogues and assassins. Their speed and versatility make them dangerous in close-quarters combat.
* battle axes: Battle axes, with their broad, curved blades, are the symbol of raw strength. These can deliver devastating blows, cleaving through enemy lines.
* clubs: Clubs, typically made from sturdy wood, are simple yet effective for swift strikes.
* flails: These weapons, made of a spiked metal ball attached to a handle by a chain, are renowned for bypassing shields and wreaking havoc on foes.
* hatchets: Hatchets are the weapon of choice for those valuing speed and agility. Though small, their swift strikes are not to be underestimated.
* maces: Maces, with their flanged metal heads, are the terror of armored adversaries. Though not the most penetrating, they can be wielded with a shield for defense.
* rapiers: Rapiers, with their slender blades, are the preferred weapons of dueling nobles and swashbucklers. They are quick and precise, though not the most damaging.
* sabres: Sabres, with their curved and sharp edge, are deadly against unarmored foes, trading raw power for agility and slicing prowess.
* spears: Spears are versatile with their reach and accuracy. Their medium length makes them easy to maneuver, and they can be wielded alongside shields.
* stilettos: Stilettos, similar to daggers but designed for armor penetration, feature a needle-like blade. They are fast, and lethal against lightly armored foes.
* swords: Swords, whether single or double-edged, are balanced between slashing and thrusting, making them versatile against various foes.
* war hammers: War hammers can switch between a flat head and a pick, allowing the wielder to adapt their attacks according to the enemy's armor.
* estocs: Estocs, with their long, narrow blades, are two-handed swords specializing in piercing through heavy armor with their pinpoint accuracy.
* great swords: Great swords are two-handed behemoths capable of inflicting grievous wounds. They are slow but devastating in the hands of a seasoned warrior.
* morning stars: Morning stars, with their large spiked heads, are like maces but with a longer handle, making them effective against various types of armor.
* pikes: Pikes, with their extreme length, allow wielders to attack from afar, making them excellent for both offense and defense in formation.
* quarterstaves: Quarterstaves, simple in appearance, can deliver powerful blows from a distance. Their long reach makes them formidable in the hands of a trained combatant.
* great axes: Great axes, with their large, curved blades, are the weapon of choice for those valuing raw power over speed. They can cleave through multiple enemies at once.


below is a description for a unique quarterstaff from pillars of eternity 2: deadfire, which you can use as a template for your own descriptions:

Though she vanished over a century ago, the Arcane Knight Shea remains a cautionary tale in her native Aedyr. Sworn to a powerful noble house of the empire, Shea never abandoned a fascination in animancy harbored since her time at the academy. She pursued her illicit interest patiently, slowly building a laboratory in her quarters at her erl's estate. When he uncovered her activities, he promised not to report her as recompense for years of service, so long as she disposed of the illegal instruments. She agreed, clearing her room of every beaker and book.

Unfortunately, she moved them into the rented basement of a shop in the nearby village and was shortly exposed by a local priest of Woedica. When the erl's leniency came to light, he suffered a profound forfeiture of wealth in levied fines and an even greater loss of face.

Shea fled the empire, crossing the sea into the Deadfire. After a brief hiatus in Neketaka, she chartered passage on a ship back west to the mainland nation of Abet. The sloop never arrived at its destination, provoking many apocryphal tales (and two popular stage plays) of the horrific results of Shea's experiments at sea.
