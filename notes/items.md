create a list of 50 items that might be found at a market in a fantasy RPG;

keep in mind the following:
* the market is located in a small town (coastal)
* the surrounding terrain is desert
* the prices should be in copper pieces (cp), given that 1 lb of wheat is worth 1 cp
* make sure each category and rarity is represented at least once
* do not mention any fantasy races (orcs, goblins, ogres, centaurs, dwarves, elves, etc.)
* The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
```json

        "weight" string,

* arbalest: Arbalests are mighty heavy crossbows favored by the stalwart. These require hand-cranking before loading, which makes their rate of fire slow, but their powerful bolts can pierce through even the sturdiest of armors.
* crossbows: Favored by nobles and common foot soldiers alike, crossbows strike a balance between power and speed. They can be cocked by hand, making them swifter than arbalests, but with slightly less power.
* hunting bows: Wielded by forest-dwellers and hunters, hunting bows are swift and silent. Although lacking the force of war bows, their quickness makes them deadly in skilled hands.
* war bows: The war bow, a weapon of choice among warriors and archers, boasts immense draw weight. Its formidable power compensates for the longer draw time as compared to hunting bows.
* blunderbusses: These loud, matchlock firearms unleash a hailstorm of projectiles, making them effective against groups. They have a fearsome reputation but struggle against heavy armor. Like other firearms, they have the ability to harm magical beings and barriers.
* pistols: These small, nimble firearms are favored for their quick reload times, though they lack the punch of larger firearms. They have the unique ability to pierce through magical protections.
* arquebuses: The arquebuses, with their matchlock mechanism, are feared for their high power and precision. Their projectiles can penetrate mystical shields and strike down ethereal foes.
* wands: Crafted from wood or bone, wands are the companions of spell-casters. Not as potent as rods or scepters, they make up for it with a faster rate of magical energy projection.
* scepters: Majestic scepters are often the mark of distinguished mages. They have versatile damage types and exude an aura of command and control.
* rods: Mighty rods, adorned with heads at both ends, are the largest of the magical implements. They channel vast amounts of arcane energy, though at a slower pace than wands and scepters.
* daggers: Daggers are swift and nimble, favored by rogues and assassins. Their speed and versatility make them dangerous in close-quarters combat.
* battle axes: Battle axes, with their broad, curved blades, are the symbol of raw strength. These can deliver devastating blows, cleaving through enemy lines.
* clubs: Clubs, typically made from sturdy wood, are simple yet effective for swift strikes.
* flails: These weapons, made of a spiked metal ball attached to a handle by a chain, are renowned for bypassing shields and wreaking havoc on foes.
* hatchets: Hatchets are the weapon of choice for those valuing speed and agility. Though small, their swift strikes are not to be underestimated.
* maces: Maces, with their flanged metal heads, are the terror of armored adversaries. Though not the most penetrating, they can be wielded with a shield for defense.
* rapiers: Rapiers, with their slender blades, are the preferred weapons of dueling nobles and swashbucklers. They are quick and precise, though not the most damaging.
* sabres: Sabres, with their curved and sharp edge, are deadly against unarmored foes, trading raw power for agility and slicing prowess.
* spears: Spears are versatile with their reach and accuracy. Their medium length makes them easy to maneuver, and they can be wielded alongside shields.
* stilettos: Stilettos, similar to daggers but designed for armor penetration, feature a needle-like blade. They are fast, and lethal against lightly armored foes.
* swords: Swords, whether single or double-edged, are balanced between slashing and thrusting, making them versatile against various foes.
* war hammers: War hammers can switch between a flat head and a pick, allowing the wielder to adapt their attacks according to the enemy's armor.
* estocs: Estocs, with their long, narrow blades, are two-handed swords specializing in piercing through heavy armor with their pinpoint accuracy.
* great swords: Great swords are two-handed behemoths capable of inflicting grievous wounds. They are slow but devastating in the hands of a seasoned warrior.
* morning stars: Morning stars, with their large spiked heads, are like maces but with a longer handle, making them effective against various types of armor.
* pikes: Pikes, with their extreme length, allow wielders to attack from afar, making them excellent for both offense and defense in formation.
* quarterstaves: Quarterstaves, simple in appearance, can deliver powerful blows from a distance. Their long reach makes them formidable in the hands of a trained combatant.
* great axes: Great axes, with their large, curved blades, are the weapon of choice for those valuing raw power over speed. They can cleave through multiple enemies at once.
