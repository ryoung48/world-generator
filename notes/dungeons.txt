keep in mind the following:
* the setting should be appropriate for a grimdark fantasy game; this setting should not include the room name
* the dungeon should have exactly 8 rooms
* a room does not need to be an interior location; it could be a forest grove, a mountain pass, a village, etc.
* do not mention any fantasy races such as elves, dwarves, goblins, orcs, ogres, etc.
* all settings, encounters, hazards, treasure locations, and enigmas should be rewritten to be related to the following themes: "corrupted forest" & "undeath"
* the last room should have a "boss" encounter

output the result as a markdown snippet formatted in the following schema:
  ```json

    "type": "ruin" | "hostile encampment" | "corrupted wilds"
