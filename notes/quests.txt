Write a list of quest objectives for a fantasy RPG quest inspired by TES daggerfall and the witcher 3 that blends elements from the two hook tags below:

    new industry: a new mining operation has recently been established in the area and is disrupting old patterns of authority
    pilgrimage site: settlement hosts a popular pilgrimage site (ancient) that draws visitors from all over the region

Keep in mind the following:
* do not mention the settlement name or any NPC names in the quest summary or objectives
* each objective should synthesize elements from the two hooks above; there should be no objectives that use only a single hook
* each objective should be accompanied by a location that describes where the objective takes place; do not use proper names in location descriptions; locations should be appropriate for a "small city"; each location should be interesting and unique;  do not repeat locations
* the surrounding terrain is jungle
* the quest giver is a templar (female)
* each objective should be a single sentence no more than 15 words long
* be as specific as possible; for example, "find the wizard's spellbook" is better than "find something valuable"
* be sure to add twists, complications, and moral dilemmas among the objectives
* The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
```json
{
    "title": string;
    "description": string; // a high level summary of the quest; do not mention surrounding terrain in this summary; make sure to justify why the quest giver is asking the player to do this quest
    "npcs": { title: string; gender: string }[] // a list of npcs involved with their occupational title and gender;
    "objectives": {
        "text": string; // do not mention locations in this text
        "location": string;
    }[] // there should be exactly 8 objectives
}
```

for the following objective:

```json
{
    "text": "Decipher the ingredients for the cure among scattered overlord documents.",
    "location": "A locked storage tent inside the overlord's camp."
}
```

use the skills listed below and flavor them to fit the objective:

mobility: acrobatics, dodging hazards, moving quickly through difficult terrain
stealth: hiding, moving quietly, pickpocketing, lockpicking, disguises
investigation: searching locations, finding people, solving puzzles
logistics: organization and execution of strategic and tactical plans
knowledge: recalling facts about arcana, history, laws, myths, etiquette, and religions
perception: notice fine details through sight, hearing, and smell
insight: detecting lies, emotions, and intent of others
survival: recalling facts about nature, navigation, handling animals, tracking, and medicine
persuasion: influencing people through negotiation, charm, oration, deception, or intimidation
athletics: running, jumping, climbing, swimming, lifting, throwing, and overcoming obstacles with brute force
combat: ambush, confront, or survive an ambush from hostile forces

The output should be a markdown code snippet formatted in the following schema:
```json
{
    "options": string[]
}
```

below is an example of what I am looking for given the following objective: 
```json
{
    "text": "Investigate the mining site for signs of desecration.",
    "location": "Noisy mining camp filled with heavy machinery next to ancient ruins."
}
```
```json
{
    "options": [
        "Use investigation skills to search for ancient markings and signs of disturbance.",
        "Utilize stealth to discreetly observe the miners’ activities around the ancient ruins.",
        "Employ knowledge of history and religions to discern the significance of the desecration."
    ]
}
```
