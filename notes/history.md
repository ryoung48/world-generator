I am building a procedurally generated history simulation; lets measure the success of a nation using the following weights (values between 0 and 1):
* military: army, navy, fortifications, siege weapons, generals, etc.
* economic: trade routes, resource management, taxation, etc.
* diplomatic: alliances, treaties, embassies, etc.
* cultural: art, literature, language, religion, etc.
* domestic: laws, governance, social cohesion, etc.

critique the list above and suggest better weights

for each of the following stats, I am trying to determine how they impact the game loop:
* military: army, navy, fortifications, siege weapons, generals, etc.
* economic: trade routes, resource management, taxation, etc.
* diplomatic: alliances, treaties, embassies, etc.
* cultural: art, literature, language, religion, etc.
* domestic: laws, governance, social cohesion, etc.

this is what I have so far:
* military: used to determine war success
* economic: investments increase development over time (technology)
* diplomatic: determines how other nations view us (likelihood of accepting alliance + trade pacts)
* domestic: controls unrest; low values trigger rebellions

** technology increases military success & economic development

how should culture impact the game loop? furthermore, how might the others impact the game loop?


lets measure the success of a nation using the following weights (values between 0 and 1):

* domestic: laws, governance, social cohesion, etc.
