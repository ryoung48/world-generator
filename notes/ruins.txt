I am procedurally generating scenes in a fantasy RPG where players are presented with a description of the location and a list of actions they can take; 

actions could involve dealing with nearby hazards, gathering information, resting, trading, searching for treasure, etc. 

each action has consequences - i.e. advancing or hindering a quest, accepting a new quest, loss of health, gold or party morale, etc.

after selecting an action, consequences are applied and the game moves to the next scene.

create a table that lists potential actions and their respective consequences; 

actions should be appropriate for a {infested|overcrowded} refugee camp in the slums
action should be appropriate for a fantasy RPG
