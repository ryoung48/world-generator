  'Border Dispute': {
    text: `They fight over a line on the map, one side claiming land that the other vows is their own, and both usually having some colorable defense to their claim. Sometimes this struggle is fueled by valuable resource deposits or significant populations in the disputed area, but other times the quarrels can spark over useless rocks in the ocean or a stretch of barren desert. In the latter case, border disputes are often pretexts to cover a less convenient reason for struggle; you might choose to roll again to find the real reason behind the fight.`,
    enemies: `Bordermarch lord, Troublesome local leader, Once-governor of the disputed land, Refugee clan head`,
    friends: `Fought-over village leader, Historian with unwanted evidence, Dweller too close to the new border, Refugee from losing side`,

  'Culture War': {
    text: `The enemies differ over extremely basic cultural or economic values and worldviews. One or both sides embrace principles that the other finds monstrous or loathsome, and popular pressure forces conflict between the two groups. These values may be entwined in the local religions, but they tend to pervade the entire culture and are held proudly as badges of identity by members of each group. Decency requires that they crush each others' filthy ways.`,

  'Curtailed Rival': {
    text: `One of the parties involved has always been a secondary power compared to the other, but recent success and expansion is making them a real threat to the stronger polity. Rulers in the latter society have decided that it is best to crush their rivals now, before they get strong enough to be a real threat. Not uncommonly, this decision is only reached long after the point where such quelling is as easy as its authors had hoped. The chastisement may focus simply on destroying those industries or resources which made the smaller group a threat, or it may be a more thorough annexation or extermination of the threatening upstart.`,
    enemies: `Cynical foreign minister, Ambitious glory-hound general, Avaricious oligarch, Minority leader collaborationist in the target nation`,

  'Ethnic Homeland': {
    text: `One of the parties to the struggle craves an ethnic homeland for their people, one where they can be ruled by their own kind in accordance with their own ways. This homeland may be based strictly on ethnic divisions, or it may instead be focused on minority religions or cultural practices. The majority party is unlikely to acquiesce in the abandonment of its rule, to say nothing of the non-ethnic locals living in the territory. These wars often take the form of long, grinding guerrilla conflicts, though some groups are strong enough to field actual armies, especially with a little help from outside parties.`,
    enemies: `Ambitious ethnarch dreaming of independence, Hereditary ruler in exile, Zealous racial purist, Determined survivor of past pogroms`,

They might be strong-armed into it by a much more powerful neighbor who wants to see them deal with a troublesome polity, or they might be under the control of powerful foreign concerns, or they may just be forced into it by cultural or religious precepts that they obey without joy. If a way can be found to lift the pressure, the war is likely to end rapidly, but otherwise it may go on to an extent that satisfies no one but a pitiless and distant master.`,

  'Forced Migration': {
    text: `The attacking party feels forced to do so, as their former nation was driven from their old lands. The entire polity is on the move, compelled to invade a neighbor due to pressure from a more powerful conqueror, an environmental catastrophe in their former lands, or some natural disaster that is rendering their old home uninhabitable. Domed cities on otherwise uninhabitable worlds often suffer this cause of war when the ancient repair mechanisms start to break down.`,

  'Hired War': {
    text: `One side of the war has been hired into attacking the other. This may be a simple case of bribery, with the rulers of one side being paid off by some interested outside power, or it might be a more complicated matter of diplomatic alliances and shared interest in another nation's downfall. The common people may or may not be aware of the real motive behind the fighting, but the rulers usually prefer to keep such sordid details out of the common eye, often crediting some wholly different reason why they simply must launch their attack.`,

  'National Honor': {

Brutal mistreatment of diplomats, savagery against innocent tourists, intentional insult of religious figures, or some other act has grievously wounded the hearts of the aggressor's people. Sometimes the local elites may not actually want a war at all, but must do something to satisfy the popular fury lest they be deposed or worse. At other times the crime is purely manufactured by the attacking nation, the better to stir up righteous wrath in the hearts of their countrymen.`,

  'National Vigor': {
    text: `A nation grows strong, too strong for its current place in the world. It chafes under old restrictions and pushes itself against the limits its old superiors have placed on it. Those agreements that were grudgingly tolerated in days of weakness now seem to be unendurable insults to their national sovereignty, and it is vital that they be thrown down. Such rumbustious new powers are often quick to turn on weaker neighbors, demonstrating their newfound importance in the wreckage of countries that were once thought their equals in weakness. At times such a nation might go too far, imagining itself great enough to challenge a planetary superpower that it thinks has grown senile or decadent in its old age.`,
    enemies: `Brash young king, Zealous general, Market-seeking colonialist, Tyrant looking for fresh glory`,

  'Political Distraction': {
    text: `Some political scandal or popular uprising threatens the security of a nation's elite, and so they find it helpful to distract the public with a convenient little war. Such fights are almost always picked with a clearly inferior foe, the better to ensure that the ensuing struggle will be a victorious feather in their collective cap. Unfortunately for the attackers, the same problems and conflicts that forced the distraction in the first place often bleed into the conduct of the war, making a sure thing less certain by far.`,

  'Political Restoration': {
    text: `The aggressors once ruled their current enemy, either holding them directly as a province or keeping them firmly within their sphere of influence. At some time in the past, their foe broke away, however, and now it's time to bring them back within the sphere of civilization.

  Razzia: {
    text: `One side is making a frankly rapacious raid on the other, determined to seize as much material wealth as possible. Some cultures may use such wars as their primary sources of sources of slaves and other finished goods, while others view them as convenient pressure releases for excess numbers of impoverished warriors or restless young men. Territorial claims aren't usually made during razzias, and the more far-sighted plunderers may intentionally avoid starving out their prey or brutalizing them beyond their ability to regrow a sufficient harvest for next time.`,

  'Religious Expansion': {
    text: `A burning faith must be carried on the edge of the sword, and at least one of the parties involved is just the army to carry it. An explosive new religion or radical religious reformation has provoked a group into conquest and proselytization. The infidel natives must be crushed and brought to the True Way, whatever that may be, for the greater glory of God. Incidentally, it also usually works out for the greater glory of the conquering nation, but such points rarely inspire great introspection.`,
